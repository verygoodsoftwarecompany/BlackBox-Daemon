# For example, if your project builds a binary named 'myprogram',
# you would add 'myprogram' or 'bin/myprogram' to ignore it.
# If using 'go build -o bin/elf', then 'bin/*' would ignore all binaries in 'bin'.
# Example:
# myprogram
# bin/

# Dependency directories (Go Modules)
# Go modules typically manage dependencies within the 'pkg/mod' directory or similar.
# These are usually handled by Go itself and don't need to be committed.
